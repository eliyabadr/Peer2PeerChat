Testing p2p-chat with Network Conditions using Clumsy.exe

Clumsy is a tool that simulates unreliable network conditions like latency, packet loss, and duplication. It's helpful to test how the p2p-chat application handles network issues.

-- Steps

1. Download Clumsy:
   - Go to the Clumsy GitHub repository: https://github.com/jagt/clumsy/releases
   - Download and extract `clumsy.exe`.

2. Setup Clumsy:
   - Open `clumsy.exe`.
   - Choose options such as:
     - Lag: Introduces delay in packets.
     - Drop: Randomly drops packets.
     - Throttle: Limits bandwidth.
   - Click Start to begin applying network effects.

3. Test p2p-chat:
   - With Clumsy running, test p2p-chat for:
     - Message delivery reliability (messages should be retried if dropped).
     - File transfer behavior under lag and drop conditions.
   - Observe how themes, emoji insertion, and retry mechanisms respond.

4. Stop Clumsy:
   - Return to Clumsy and click Stop to restore normal network conditions.
